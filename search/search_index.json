Whenever you make any changes to the database models, you will need to generate a new Alembic \"revision\". You can use the bin/db-revision.sh script to help create a new revision after you've made some changes to the database models: bin/db-revision.sh \"Some short note\" This script uses Alembic's \"autogenerate\" feature to create what it thinks is the correct database migration script for the changes you made.
